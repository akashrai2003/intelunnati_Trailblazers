# Introduction
The lives of individuals have been impacted by significant technological flaws in recent years as a result of information sharing.
The era of social media has accelerated the spread of a lot of fake news from anti-social groups throughout the globe.
Applying the machine learning techniques we learned in class will help our group tackle this challenge by producing a result 
that makes it posssible for us to do so.
The spread of false information has caused instablity in both past and the present,
whihch has also resulted in the loss of human lives. In order to detect wether news is legitimate and bogus using machine learning concepts,
our organiztion aims to help ensure peace and sanity.

# Fake news detection
In this project, we have used various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms
to clarify fake news article using sci-kit libraries from python. We have also used a pre trained model that is BERT,
Instead of only human-generated fake news classification we have also added another parameter in our Labels
feature and that is AI-generated fake news as nowadays many sources do use AI-generated text for creating Fake News.
