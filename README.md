# Introduction
The lives of individuals have been impacted by significant technological flaws in recent years as a result of information sharing.
The era of social media has accelerated the spread of a lot of fake news from anti-social groups throughout the globe.
Applying the machine learning techniques we learned in class will help our group tackle this challenge by producing a result 
that makes it posssible for us to do so.
The spread of false information has caused instablity in both past and the present,
whihch has also resulted in the loss of human lives. In order to detect wether news is legitimate and bogus using machine learning concepts,
our organiztion aims to help ensure peace and sanity.

# Fake news detection
In this project, we have used various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms
to clarify fake news article using sci-kit libraries from python. We have also used a pre trained model that is BERT,
Instead of only human-generated fake news classification we have also added another parameter in our Labels
feature and that is AI-generated fake news as nowadays many sources do use AI-generated text for creating Fake News.

# Dataset

We had been given the ISOT Dataset as our base dataset and no restrictions were placed on adding more on top of it, so we tried to add more datasets due to the reason that our news dataset covers only a limited number of domains such as Politics and World-News focused on US & Middle-East governments. This couldnâ€™t be effective for news from different domains, so we combined it with other resources, but it took different pre-processing techniques for each of them respectively before concatenating them and would be attempted later on while pursuing to perfectly complete our project as a whole and being deployed.
